# Description
 Differential expression comparisons using DESEq2 for all 3 datasets:1) Metabolites, 2) 16S, and 3) WGS. The metabolites data was split into 2 parts. The first part includes only bile aicds, and the 2nd part includes everything not bile acid. For both 16S and WGS microbial expression was examined. Expression was examined at both 2 and 5 between Placebo (P) vs. Letrozole (LET) and Letrozle vs. Cohoused-Letrozole (LET<sup>ch</sup>).

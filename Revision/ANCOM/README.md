ANCOM Analyses

All these analyses are based on ANCOM version 2.1 [1,2]. The directories  include Jupyter Notebooks and features tables for all the various multiomics datasets from Ho et al. "Gut metabolites are more predictive of disease- and cohoused- states than gut bacterial features in a mouse model of polycystic ovary syndrome" to allow for reproduction of the results, as well as volcano plots and tables of all the non-zero W features in the output.

16S = 16S rRNA OTU features.
BA = Identified bile acid features from the metabolomics analysis.
Metabolites = Identified metabolite features that were not bile acids.
WGS = Whole Genome Shotgun taxonomic feature table.
